# Hi there üëã, my name is **Sayan Roy**
## **DATA SCIENCE ENTHUSIAST**

Hi, I'm Sayan Roy and currently I am a third year Chemical Engineering Student from [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in). In 2020 around March in India, the Covid-19 cases was increasing and the government declared lockdown. That time I got a messge from my friends to learn Python Programming Language from an online learning source, [MyWBUT](https://www.mywbut.com). While doing this couse, my teacher, [Nitish Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitish-singh-03412789) of the course suggested to create an Portfolio Website. And that is the key point of my life that I got very interested in programming world. After that one month of the  course, I was interested towards Machine Learning as well as Web Development. I took Web Development and Machine Learning course under him. I wanted to build my portfolio website from scratch, don't want to use a template for this. As well as I was also improving my Machine Learning skills. But one point came where I have to focused to that one topic, either Machine Learning or Web Development at a time because thses technologies are very vast.   

I choosed Web Development and was starting to improve skills in this domain like CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, NextJs. I did many projects related to this field and then I realised that my primary goal is become a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer. Then I switched to the Data Science field and now completly focused on this field. Now I am very passionate to learn different and new Data Science and ML learning techniques and my goal is be an expert to this field.
